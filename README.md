üß† 3. How the Recommendation System Works
Trigger: A user visits their shopping cart.

API Call: The Spring Boot backend sends the product IDs from the cart to a Python Flask API endpoint (/recommend).

ML Magic: The Python service uses a content-based filtering model to find similar items by comparing their category, subcategory, and brand.

Response: The model returns a list of recommended product IDs back to the Spring Boot application.

Display: The recommended products are fetched from the database and beautifully displayed to the user on the cart page.

‚ú® 4. Summary of Recent Changes
Backend Updates
UserController.java: Enhanced to call the ML recommendation API from the /cart endpoint.

Product.java Model: Upgraded with new fields for brand and subcategory to enrich product data.

New Files Added:
